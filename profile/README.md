## 🗺️ Our Mission

**AEON Observatory** is a research initiative dedicated to the rigorous auditing of AI ecosystems. We treat the global landscape of AI models not as a static list, but as a dynamic, evolving **biological system**.

By combining **Geometric Topology**, **In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED)**, and **Active Probing**, we provide the mathematical tools to:
* 🛡️ **Detect Model Cloning:** Identify redundant models and "wrapper" products via **PIER** (Peer-Inexpressible Residual).
* 🧬 **Map Evolutionary Lineage:** Trace the ancestry of fine-tuned models.
* 🔭 **Reveal Blind Spots:** Use tomographic scanning to find semantic gaps in model capabilities.

## 🧭 Repository Navigation

We operate as an "Open Core" laboratory. Our research infrastructure is split into three pillars:

### 1. The Core Engine (Open Source) 🟢
**[`aeon`](https://github.com/AEON-Observatory/aeon)**
> The official Python SDK. It contains the mathematical implementation of our auditing algorithms.
> * **Use this if:** You are a researcher or developer who wants to run audits in your own Python environment.
> * `pip install aeon-lab` (Coming soon)

### 2. The Platform (SaaS) 🔒
**[AEON Platform (ecoobs.org)](https://ecoobs.org)**
> The commercial-grade dashboard powered by the AEON SDK.
> * **Use this if:** You are a social scientist, enterprise user, or policymaker requiring visual reports without coding.

### 3. Academic Evidence (Reproducibility) 📄
We believe in radical transparency. Every paper we publish has a dedicated repository for full reproducibility.

| Year | Paper Title | Code Repository | Key Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2025** | *Active Representation Field Tomography* | [**`paper-2025-tomography`**](https://github.com/AEON-Observatory/paper-2025-tomography) | Active Learning, Geometry |
| **2024** | *Quantifying Model Uniqueness in Heterogeneous Ecosystems* | [**`paper-2024-pier`**](https://github.com/AEON-Observatory/paper-2024-pier) | ISQED, PIER Score |

## 🔬 Key Technologies

We build on the intersection of Machine Learning, Convex Optimization, and Distributed Systems.

* **In-Silico Quasi-Experiments:** Creating "parallel universes" to isolate model behavior (Type-A vs Type-B effects).
* **Convex Hull Projection:** Using `cvxpy` to calculate the exact redundancy of neural representations.
* **Active Auditing:** Utilizing Ray for distributed, uncertainty-aware probing of black-box APIs.
